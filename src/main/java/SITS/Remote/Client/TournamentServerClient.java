	//and since the Remote PArticipant is using Remote Template i guess I'll keep the same style

	public TournamentServerClient(String server_url) 
	{
    	this.server_url = server_url;
    	this.client = RestClient.create(); 

    }
    or even the whole thing in Main() like how the restPassowrdServer 
    Example looks like.
    
    if im keeping with the design document then the list tounaments would look closer to this
    
    public List<?> listTournaments() {
         return client.get()
				.uri(server_url + "/tournaments")
                .retrieve()
                .body(List.class);
	} 
	like why am I doing this stupid rest template stuff. anyways. 
	in the pursuit of knowledge i guess. 
	
	i did not digress in my earlier comment. 
	
	 * */
	
	//should only be read only here so I guess this <?> is fine 
	public List<?> listTournaments()
	{
		return restTemplate.getForObject(server_url+ "/tournaments",List.class); 
	}
